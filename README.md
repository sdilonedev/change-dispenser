## How It Works

The script takes the amount of change to be given and the available denominations in the cash register. It then calculates the optimal combination of coins and bills to provide the change, ensuring that the cash register maintains an efficient inventory.

### Example

If the cash register has the following denominations:

- Bills: 100, 50, 20, 10
- Coins: 5, 2, 1

And the customer is owed **87** units of change, the script will return:

- 1 x 50
- 1 x 20
- 1 x 10
- 1 x 5
- 1 x 2

## Usage

1. Define the available denominations and quantities in the `denominations` dictionary inside the script.
